\begin{abstract}
We present a novel memory leak detection algorithm searching for potential
leaks at runtime.
Besides scenarios when a part of allocated heap becomes unreachable,
we are able to report when objects are still reachable but
should have been released nevertheless.
The algorithm is based on statistical profiling and can be parameterized in order to
keep the overhead low and reduce the number of reported false positives.
The peak runtime overhead is less than 3\% and it is negligible for the rest of time.
There is no memory overhead and the method works
with any allocator.
What distinguishes our detector from the majority of broadly used tools,
it does not require the process to terminate.

These attributes make it an ideal tool for analyzing a web browser application.
We explain how we have applied our method to the Chromium browser and give
examples of the leaks found.

Low-overhead monitoring, runtime analysis, memory leaks

\section{Introduction}

Memory leaks occur when an application fails to release memory which is no longer needed.
Memory leaks waste Random Access Memory (RAM) and thus reduce computer performance.
Small and outwardly harmless memory leaks often go unnoticed for an extended period
of time until they aggregate and then become problematic.
At this point, though, it is harder to locate and rectify the sources of the leaks.
Thus, it is helpful to detect memory leaks before they reduce the performance of computers.

Recent years brought new challenges in the field of memory leak detection.
Well-known tools such as Valgrind, LeakSanitizer, Purify \cite{valgrind, leak-san, purify} were designed
for processes running on a local machine and with the analysis
performed after the process terminates.
These assumption are not satisfied for, e.g. server processes
that are meant to run indefinitely, or web browsers whose processes
do not terminate until they run out of memory.
On the other hand, intensive monitoring of allocation history
introduces a noticeable overhead which spoils the user experience.
We present a heuristic-based algorithm that is free of mentioned issues.
It is based on profiling and therefore it works best for applications used widely
by customers.

To clarify the goals of the algorithm let us start with defining the problem.
An object in memory is \textit{leaked} at time $t$ if it is never accessed
after time $t$.
An object is \textit{unreachable} at time $t$ if there is no reference chain
leading to it starting from global or stack variables.
It is easy to see that every unreachable object is at the same time leaked.
Whereas detecting unreachability is easy with access to the reference graph,
in general it is impossible to foresee if an object is going to be used in the future.
In order to be completely sure about finding all the leaks, one should analyze whole
allocation history after the process is terminated and detect moments when objects cease being accessed
\todo{any profiler working like this?}.
This approach is burdened with a large overhead though, what makes it practical only
for local runs.

Chromium -- the application we experiment on -- is an open-source web browser project~\cite{chromium} written in C++.
It operates with a single \textit{browser} process and a family
of \textit{renderer} processes, each responsible for a group
of tabs associated with a single domain.
Chrome -- one of many Chromium builds -- is currently the most popular web browser in global scope~\cite{wikimedia}.


\section{Related work}

On the highest level, memory leak detectors can be divided into static
and dynamic types.
Static detectors process the code itself apart from any runtime scenario
looking for any leak that is possible to happen.
Even basing on heuristics, they require a lot of computational power.
Xie and Aiken~\cite{boolean} managed to investigate six large open source
projects, including Linux kernel, with false positive ratio 10.8\%
by expressing the problem with boolean constraints.
The state-of-art static leak detectors employs a value-flow
analysis \cite{flow, saber}.

More common dynamic leak detectors analyze allocation history during runtime.
The easiest approach is to detect variables getting unreachable
what can be performed, e.g. using \textit{mark and sweep} technique~\cite{mark-and-sweep}
known mainly from its application to JVM (Java Virtual Machine) garbage collector \todo{cite}.
One of the first dynamic detectors, Purify~\cite{purify}, searches for memory leaks by injecting its instructions
into the object code.
It introduces runtime overhead of factor 3-5 what is acceptable for running
the code locally.
This kind of analysis is easily combined with detecting other memory access errors
such as buffer overflow, multiple frees, or accesses to already freed memory.
LeakSanitizer, a tool supported by Clang compiler~\cite{leak-san}, can be used with AddressSanitizer
which helped finding over 300 bugs in Chromium~\cite{address}.
Similar functionality is offered by Valgrind working with GCC compiler~\cite{valgrind}.

A remarkable examples of detectors which go beyond the unreachability analysis
are Cork~\cite{cork} and Sleigh~\cite{sleigh}, tools designed for garbage-collected languages.
Cork achieves low runtime overhead (2.3\%) by augmenting the work of the garbage collector
and Sleigh uses several components inside the JVM.
Another approach to extract interesting information from allocation history
is to analyze only containers.
Xu and Rountex~\cite{containers} implemented a leak detector tracking staleness
of elements in Java containers with rules based on a combination of
object's memory consumption and the time since last retrieval.

When tracking memory bugs gets difficult for automatic tools, one might
try running a human-driven memory profiler and analyze the information about the heap usage
to detect parts of the application consuming too much memory.
An attempt to create such a profiler was undertaken in the Chromium project
which resulted in releasing the
Deep Memory Profiler~\cite{deep}.
It helped finding several memory leaks, however it became impractical
and has not been maintained since 2015.

The disadvantages of the most of dynamic leak detectors are the requirement of a process
to terminate and the employment of complex data structures tracking the heap behavior.
To surpass them, one can take advantage of statistical techniques.

An implementation of a leak detection algorithm based on the statistical profiling
has been described by Hauswirth and Chilimbi~\cite{hauswirth}.
They have achieved a low runtime overhead ($<5\%$ with sampling rate $0.1\%$) and have not required a process
to terminate.
The implementation of the algorithm, a SWAT library, was tested (however only locally) on two computer games, multimedia application,
and web application and was able to detect some real memory leaks, however no statistics about false positives were given.

The algorithm tries to detect heap objects that have not been accessed for a long time.
This is done by explicit heap monitoring which introduces also some space overhead (up to 10\%).
An interesting idea of their work is an enhancement of the sampling rate
for infrequently executed code segments in order to cover miscellaneous allocation events.
This makes the leak detector better suited for checking total correctness of
the application.
Our approach is more pragmatical -- we consciously pay more attention to instructions
allocating more memory and focus on minimizing the total waste of RAM.

\section{Our contribution}

We present a new approach to the memory leak detection via the statistical profiling
and explain what are the applications for which our algorithm is suitable.
Our design is crafted for keeping the overhead low and working with any
allocator type.

The algorithm has been implemented for Chromium and deployed.
We elaborate on the non-trivial aspects of the implementation.
Finally we describe the results of running our detector on remote
devices and processing the gathered data that comes from the end users.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to publish results
of such an experiment.
In Section~\ref{sec:results} we show particular Chromium issues
that have been detected and repaired with a help of our tool.

\section{The algorithm}
\label{sec:algorithm}

As we want to detect leaks in a real-time, with little overhead and little interference with
the allocation strategy, we need some assumptions about the nature of the application.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Most allocation instructions are correct.
\item The allocation events can be clustered in a relatively small number of groups
	such that each leak should fall into a single bucket.
\item There is no garbage-collecting mechanism running in the background.
	See Section \ref{sec:false} for explanation.
\end{enumerate}

The algorithm is designed to work in several tiers.
This makes it possible to distinguish potential leaks basing only on coarse statistics before spending resources on investigating more
precise data.
In each tier the allocation events are divided into \textit{allocation buckets}.
The buckets should be designed in such a way that every leak could be observed within a single bucket,
or -- if this is infeasible -- within a small percentage of buckets.
When a bucket is diagnosed to contain a potential leak, the next tier is launched and the bucket gets dismantled
into subbuckets.
If the last tier is reached then a report is generated and sent to the profiling server.

In our implementation we initially focus on the size of allocation.
For the sake of efficiency each bucket tracks some size class --
in the implementation each class is given as $[4i, 4(i+1))$ bytes for some $i$.
In the second tier buckets are defined by the call stack of the allocation instruction
(or some part of the call stack, see Section \ref{sec:params}).
Observe that this schema might not work for every type of application.
For example, if the leaked memory consists of arrays with dynamically calculated sizes,
a memory growth might be observed in many allocation buckets.
In this situation one should consider a different design of tiers.

In every tier the leak detector operates in two alternating modes which are
the data gathering interval and the analyze phase.
The time-flow in the algorithm is measured with the total number of bytes allocated on the heap
by all the processes of the application, without subtracting any frees.
During the data gathering interval each allocation and deallocation is recorded with some
probability.
When a fixed amount of memory allocations pass then the analysis is launched.

In the analysis phase, the traced allocation buckets are sorted with respect to the \textit{net number} of allocations
in the last interval
(the net number of allocations is the difference between the total numbers of allocation at
the beginning and at the end of the interval).
The aim of this phase is to mark outstanding buckets as suspects.
Observe that this would be impossible without assumptions that
most of the memory management is correct and each occurring leak
touches only a small number of buckets.

One could employ arbitrary clustering schema to detect outliers among the buckets.
The mechanism we have implemented is as follows.
Let $(a_i)$ be the sequence of net allocations of each bucket sorted in a non-increasing order
and let $j$ be the first index such that $a_j > 2a_{j+1}$.
If there is no such index or $j > \texttt{RANKING\_SIZE}$ (see Section \ref{sec:params}) then no anomalies are recorded.
Otherwise all buckets with $a_i \ge a_j$ are marked suspect.
When a bucket is marked for sufficiently many times in a row,
we call it suspect and move on to the next tier.

	\caption{Common peaks in memory usage should not raise an alert.}
\label{fig:chart3}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Parameters}
\label{sec:params}

In this section we present a list of most important parameters of the algorithm.
They should be empirically adjusted to find the best compromise between
effectiveness and overhead, as well as between sensitivity and the false positive ratio.

\begin{enumerate}

\item \texttt{SAMPLING\_RATE}: The probability of an allocation
	event being recorded by the leak detector.
	It allows to reduce almost total overhead while keeping the algorithm correct.
	The Figure \ref{fig:overhead} shows that the reduction of overhead is close
	to being proportional to the \texttt{SAMPLING\_RATE}.
	Setting this value low reduces the probability of finding a particular leak
	but this can be balanced by enabling the detector for a larger percentage of users.

\item \texttt{ANALYSIS\_INTERVAL}: Number of bytes to be allocated on the heap before the next
	analysis phase starts.
	It is supposed to be large enough so the running time of the analysis does not
	affect user experience.
	Our implementation performs analysis after every 32 megabytes allocated
	on the heap.

\item \texttt{SUSPICION\_THRESHOLD}: Number of times in a row an allocation bucket
	has to be marked suspect to trigger an alert.
	It should be set sufficiently high to suppress generating alerts for code that initializes resources
	with a caveat that a too large value might affect the detector's sensitivity.

\item \texttt{RANKING\_SIZE}: Number of the most active allocation buckets
	that is being checked in the analysis phase.
	Activeness is measured as a net number of allocations in the last interval.
	The value of \texttt{RANKING\_SIZE} should be between the maximum number
	of allocation buckets that may simultaneously generate leaks and the
	number of active buckets during valid resources initialization.

\item \texttt{MAX\_STACK\_DEPTH}: Indicates how deep the call stack is read to
	identify the context of an allocation.
	Call sites that differ only in the base level of the stack are likely to
	work with similar logic and therefore should be clustered together
	in the leak analysis.
	It is also worth mentioning that reading each level of the call stack
	has a noticeable cost in the running time.
	In the implementation \texttt{MAX\_STACK\_DEPTH} has been set to 4,
	however each level may contain numerous inlined function calls.

\item \texttt{HIGH\_WATER\_MARK}: The minimum number of total allocated bytes for an
	allocation bucket to be considered a potential leak.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Dealing with false positives}
\label{sec:false}

There are many valid patterns in the heap allocation history that might trigger the algorithm's
heuristics.
Fortunately the parameters of the leak detector can be tuned up to ignore the most of
the false positive patterns.

Lot of memory gets allocated in the first seconds of the browser's bootstrapping
and stays on the heap until the process termination (see Figure \ref{fig:chart1}).
Setting high \texttt{ANALYSIS\_INTERVAL} and \texttt{SUSPICION\_THRESHOLD}
prevents raising an alert when the growth is temporary.
High \texttt{SUSPICION\_THRESHOLD} helps also against memory usage peaks
occurring alongside computing expensive functions (see Figure \ref{fig:chart3}).
Loading a new page might increase the number of allocations in a small
number of buckets (see Figure \ref{fig:chart4}).
To avoid marking them suspect one should set high \texttt{HIGH\_WATER\_MARK}
and low \texttt{RANKING\_SIZE}.

Unfortunately there also exist valid patterns that are hardly distinguishable from
the memory leaks.
One of them is generated by data structures with their own garbage-collecting mechanisms.
For example, buffers for video data do not release cached objects until some storage threshold
is reached or they are notified that the operating system is under memory pressure.
There is a simple argument that this intractability is inevitable.
The decision whether a container is a source of a memory leak
depends on its future usage.
If some stale data remain in the buffer and the garbage-collection is never triggered
then this should be considered a leak.

A practical way to deal with this kind of reports is to
classify false positives by call stacks.
The profiling server can store a list of call stack patterns
which have been generated by a garbage-collecting container
after they are reported once.
This way engineers working on the application's memory usage
can filter out the uninteresting reports.

\section{Implementation}
The leak detector has been implemented in C++ and submitted to the Chromium repository, where
it can be browsed~\cite{chromium-leak}.
In this section we will focus only on the non-trivial aspects of the implementation.

\subsection{Hooks}

The leak detector logic has been injected in the \texttt{malloc} and \texttt{free} functions
and then compiled with the rest of the application.
All the additional code is located in \textit{hooks}: \texttt{AllocHook(const void*~p, size\_t size)}
and \texttt{FreeHook(const void* p)}
(see a high-level pseudocode in algorithms~(\ref{alg:alloc-hook}) and~(\ref{alg:free-hook})),
that get called after the allocation/deallocation is completed.

As the leak detector module also performs allocation, there is a risk
of creating a loop.
To avoid this, hooks are surrounded by guard checks and do not proceed
if called inside themselves.
However, this way the leak detector cannot track leaks generated by itself.

\subsection{Critical path and sampling}

Since we want to work with any allocator, we must inject the detector's logic into
standard signatures \texttt{(const void* p, size\_t size)} for allocation and
\texttt{(const void* p)} for freeing memory.
Every time these routines are called we need to increment a counter (only for allocation),
perform a sampling procedure, and -- if the event gets sampled -- launch the analysis algorithm.
Whereas the overhead created by the majority of operations can be suppressed by setting a low
sampling factor, counting and sampling form the critical path.

Incrementing the counter is necessary to perform the analysis phase in fixed intervals.
Synchronizing the access to the counter variable across many threads is expensive,
so the counter has been implemented efficiently using a thread-local storage (TLS).
At a single allocation event the thread-local counter is incremented and after every \texttt{UPDATE\_INTERVAL}
bytes of allocation the global counter gets updated.
Choosing the value of \texttt{UPDATE\_INTERVAL} is a trade-off between frequency of concurrent accesses
to the shared memory and providing granularity.
We set it to \texttt{ANALYSIS\_INTERVAL} divided by 1024.

The second instruction on the critical path is sampling.
The algorithm cannot track freeing a memory which allocation has not been recorded
so \texttt{free(p)} should be sampled if and only if the related malloc had been been sampled.
Hence, the result of \texttt{ShouldSample(p)} should depend only on the value of~\texttt{p}.
Our implementation uses a fast multiplicative hashing function with the hash multiplier taken from the FarmHash library~\cite{farmhash}
to transform the value of~\texttt{p} into a pseudo-random variable with an uniform
distribution on $[0, 2^{64})$ and proceeds if it hits a segment of size proportional
to the \texttt{SAMPLING\_RATE}.
Observe that even if the allocator assigns exactly the same address repeatedly during a single execution --
what skews the distribution of hash values -- this would not perturb the memory leak analysis.
This is because an address may be reused only after the object previously occupying
this place in memory is deallocated.
Therefore, such a sequence of allocations cannot be a part of a memory leak.

	\caption{A comparison of the overhead for different values of \texttt{SAMPLING\_RATE}.

	\EndIf
	\State \texttt{RecordFree(GetSize(p), GetCallStack(MAX\_STACK\_DEPTH));}
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\label{alg:free-hook}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Data structures and the analysis phase}

Functions \texttt{RecordAlloc} and \texttt{RecordFree}
need to access counters specific for an allocation bucket. 
Depending on the active tier, buckets may be characterized
by the allocation size class or \texttt{MAX\_STACK\_DEPTH}
lines from the call stack.
We have used hash maps to ensure average $O(1)$ bucket update time.
In order to compare the net allocation number between successive
analysis phases, one has to maintain hash maps from the previous phase
and operate on fresh ones.

Another hash map is necessary to keep track sizes of
allocated objects -- this is read inside \texttt{FreeHook}
as \texttt{GetSize(p)}.

The analyzing routine has been described in Section~\ref{sec:algorithm}.
The main part is obtaining \texttt{RANKING\_SIZE} most
active allocation buckets and performing the outlier detection.
The value of \texttt{RANKING\_SIZE} is usually very little when
compared with the total number of allocation buckets,
so it might be tempting to optimize this part with some sophisticated data structures.
However, the computational bottleneck lies elsewhere.
Indeed, for each bucket we need to update the hash map
storing the data from the previous step in order to compare against
it in the next step.
The analysis phase runs relatively infrequently though and we have agreed there is
no need for any further optimizations in this place.

\subsection{Extracting call stacks}

In order to generate legible reports about the leaks found, one
need to refer to the names of functions in the call stack.
The default way to provide this kind of information is to
include additional data about the origin of each instruction,
i.e. the file name and the line number, in the binary file.
However this affects noticeably the binary size.

Alternatively, one can perform symbolization after the report
arrives at the server of the profiling service.
We assume there is a function \texttt{GetCallStack}
available in the application code, returning addresses of functions on the stack
up to a given depth.
The raw address of a function in the binary, combined with a build identifier,
is sufficient to determine the pre-compilation symbol name and the
exact place of origin.
In practice the symbolization requires keeping an array of reverse-compilation data for each build,
which might be large.
Such a service is maintained as a part of Google-wide Profiling~\cite{gwp}
and supports symbolization for all official Chromium builds.

\section{Results for Chromium}
\label{sec:results}

In this section we give several examples of memory leaks in Chromium found
thanks to our method.
We also elaborate why finding them might have been difficult without our tool.

\subsection{Unreleased variables in the Flash plugin \cite{cr-flash}}

The Flash plugin API in Chromium uses a refcounting (i.e. reference counting) system when passing variables between it and the rest of Chromium.
This is usually necessary to keep track of how long the object is being used and
to deallocate its memory as soon as there are no more references to it.
However, objects of some moderately simple types (in particular String, Array, and Dictionary)
get reconstituted once passed to the other side of the Flash-Chromium boundary, and therefore no refcounting is required.
The reference counter of the variable must be then released, or otherwise the refcount tracking data
structure (a hash map) will accumulate entries and grow in memory usage.
This is an example of a memory bloat occurring in a data structure
that does not constitute a leak itself and therefore it is difficult to diagnose (see Section~\ref{sec:false}).
Our algorithm was able to detect it because allocations involved in the memory bloat share common allocation sizes.

\subsection{Delete old renderer pass mappings \cite{cr-mappings}}

\todo{Rewrite} The Chromium compositor performs multiple-pass rendering and keeps track of which passes have been
made on each compositor surface during the rendering of a frame.
Entries to track rendering passes that were not used for the current frame
remained in memory indefinitely.
This was fixed by deleting the entries that were not used for the current frame.

\subsection{Orphaned interprocess communication requests \cite{cr-orphaned}}

Chromium employs an interprocess communication pipeline that passes frames between the browser and renderer processes (see Introduction).
If a frame from the browser has been deleted before the renderer receives it,
the renderer process would still maintain an open connection handle to wait for the frame.
As more frames get deleted this way, the renderer accumulates more handles while waiting for frames that will never arrive.
The issue has been fixed by introducing a mechanism in the browser process that erases the connection handle once the frame gets deleted.

\subsection{Memory pressure during video playback \cite{cr-playback}}

The leak detector has revealed that the memory buffers used in the video playback
have been employing over 200 MB of memory on Chromebooks with only 2 GB of total memory and less than 200 MB of free memory.
This was reported to the Chrome video team, which decided that the garbage collection of video playback
buffers needs to be more aggressive on low-memory systems.

\subsection{History accumulates redundant nodes with automatic refreshing \cite{cr-refresh}}

In order to help user keep track of the previously visited pages, a browser should maintain a history.
It can be implemented as a tree data structure with an access to the previous node for each entry.
The history may have limited capacity or
we may assume that the user will not be able
to visit too many sites during one session.
However, a problem arises when a script refreshes a page automatically in short intervals.
This makes the history grow incessantly.

The problem cannot be diagnosed with a simple reachability analysis as the redundant
nodes are stored in a container that itself does not leak.
It is also impossible to track it with a static analysis as the issue is related to an exterior
code that is being interpreted by the application.
The problem could have been found within the regular debugging phase during the development process as
it escalates quickly (leaving such a script running overnight can make the browser crash)
compared to other memory leaks.
However it is impossible to visit every problematic web site in the testing phase.
The other idea may be to wait until the problem makes the browser crash at the user's device
and then investigate the crash report.
Unfortunately when a process is killed under the memory pressure there is no time neither for an extensive
heap analysis nor for sending whole memory image with the report.

\subsection{Per-file updates when opening file viewer \cite{bug-files}}

When the file viewer application in Chromium opens a folder, it creates a file change object to track the presence of each file in the folder.
After all files have been tracked with these objects, then they may be deleted,
However, when opening a folder with a large number of files, many objects are created at once
without waiting until others get deleted.
This creates a temporary spike in the memory usage, what could perturb the fluency of execution.
Although the memory bloat may occur only in a short period of time,
our algorithm measures time flow by the number of allocations and
is likely to launch the analysis phase during such a spike.

This issue has been reported recently and has not been addressed yet in time of preparing this article.

\section{Discussion}

The main area in which the algorithm might possibly be improved is
the outlier detection phase.
The procedure described in Section~\ref{sec:algorithm} is fast and easy to implement
but adding a single element with a very high value of $a_i$ can totally alter the judgment
for other elements.
It might be interesting to investigate methods based on measuring distance from the mean or the median
of all the values in question.
Another trace is to try clustering approach to identify a group of the buckets that grows
significantly faster than others.
